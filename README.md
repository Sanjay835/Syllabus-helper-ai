# Syllabus-helper-ai
Syllabus Helper AI is an intelligent Java-based assistant that answers student doubts using syllabus PDFs.
It uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLaMA models (via Groq API) to extract relevant information from notes and provide accurate, syllabus-based answers.
Built entirely with Java, the system reads PDF content, finds the best matching context, and generates exam-oriented responses through an LLM.
